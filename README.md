Hello.

This is a script for installing an SVN server with apache2 support.
If the script executes correctly on your system, 
you will be able to access your SVN repositories via http or https (depending on your apache2 config).

I made this script to make it easier to set up an SVN server on my new Raspberry Pi, 
so I thought I could might as well share it with the public, as I really did struggle to find
readable documentation on how to set up SVN on a headless Debian System.

The script propably won't be maintained, as it works correctly on my system.
Even though feel free to extend or debug the script or maybe just look at the code.
Have fun :)
